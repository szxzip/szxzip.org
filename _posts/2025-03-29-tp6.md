Is English difficult to learn? If you always fear difficulty, lack determination and perseverance, and always forget what you've learned, you'll find it a headache for you.

Is it easy to learn? So long as you master the rules for use, and know the western culture and custom, you'll gain sharp sense of language.

Listen more, speak more, read more, recite more and write more. You'd better create situation actively in which you can use English, and try to change English in books, on tapes and spoken by others into a handy tool.

In the future you'll be a half—deaf and half dumb person if you don't know English.

英语难学吗？如果你总是害怕困难，缺少决心和毅力，并总是遗忘所学的东西，你会感到学英语是一件头痛的事。

英语易学吗？只要你掌握使用规律，了解西方的文化和习俗，积极运用，你就能养成敏锐的语感。

多听、多说、多读、多背、多写。主动创造使用英语的语境，尽力把书本上的以及别人口头的英语变成自己得心应手的工具。

未来，如果你不懂英语，你就会变成一个半聋半哑的人。
